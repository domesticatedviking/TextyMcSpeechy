# URLS for default checkpoint files

# This "generic.conf" file is primarily provided to ease the frustration of users who are having trouble choosing appropriate pretrained checkpoints
# The selection on huggingface does not provide a complete set of checkpoints in any language, and some of the checkpoint files provided there have compatibility issues.
# The quality of voices trained using these checkpoints may not be as good as voices trained from checkpoints with the correct language and voice type.
# However they will allow you to train a voice in any language.
