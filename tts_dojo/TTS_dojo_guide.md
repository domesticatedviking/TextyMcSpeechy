# TTS Dojo

- The TTS Dojo is a set of shell scripts that use [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) to produce custom text-to-speech models by finetuning pretrained Piper TTS checkpoint files.
- Piper's training services are provided via a docker container called `textymcspeechy-piper`, which can either be downloaded from dockerhub or built locally.
- Voice dojos automatically start the `textymcspeechy-piper` docker image by calling `TextyMcSpeechy/run_container.sh` and automatically stop it when training ends.
- If you have set up custom pronunciation rules in `tts_dojo/ESPEAK_RULES`, these can be configured to be activated automatically when your container runs.  A guide can be found [here](tts_dojo/ESPEAK_RULES/README_custom_pronunciation.md)
 

## About the training process
- The [quick_start_guide](https://github.com/domesticatedviking/TextyMcSpeechy/blob/docker-dev/quick_start_guide.md) contains everything you need to know about getting your first training session running
- Be aware the provided training scripts delete all data stored in  `<VOICE_NAME>_dojo/training_folder/lightning_logs` at the beginning of each training run.
- When training starts, the training scripts run in a multi-window environment provided by `tmux`.  The tmux session is named `training`.
- The training session can be shut down from any terminal window with the command `tmux kill-session` if there is a problem and the normal ways of shutting the session down are unavailable.
- If your training session crashes you may need to manually bring down the `textymcspeechy-piper` docker image.  Check its status by running `docker ps` 
- You can shut the docker container down manually by either:
   1. navigating to the main `TextyMcSpeechy` folder and running `./stop_container.sh`
   2. running `docker stop textymcspeechy-piper` from any terminal window.
- The layout of the training panes isn't always ideal the first time you run a training session. You can drag the boundaries between panes around with your mouse to adjust them to your liking.  The layout can be saved by clicking on the "CONTROL CONSOLE" pane and pressing `t`.  This layout will be applied automatically on future training runs.
 

## What do the different windows in the training dojo do?
0. `PIPER TRAINING RAW OUTPUT`  This pane contains all of the text generated by piper as it trains your model.   I generally recommend making this pane 2 rows tall since most of the information provided here isn't very useful.  There are often many warnings that appear in this pane.   Most of them can be ignored.
   - The best indicator that your training session is working properly is when  `rank_zero_warn (` appears at the bottom of this pane. It is normal for this to appear for several minutes as training is initializing.   
   - You may see a warning about a low number of workers being a bottleneck.  Currently the only way to resolve this is to modify piper's source code.
   - If you see an error related to `zip` files here, this usually means your starting checkpoint file is corrupted.   Either restart training or delete the highest epoch checkpoint in the `voice_checkpoints` directory.  
1. `TENSORBOARD SERVER`  This pane runs a web server that lets you view graphs related to training progress.  Open http://localhost:6006 in your web browser if you want to see them.  When the graph for `loss_disc_all` levels off, your model is probably almost ready.  It isn't necessary to use this at all during training but I provide it for those who prefer a more quantitative approach than "listening to a model and seeing if it sounds good".
2. `TTS MODEL EXPORTER` This pane contains piper's output when it converts a checkpoint file into a `.onnx` file.  It can be reduced to a single row high since it produces almost no output during normal operation.
3. `CHECKPOINT GRABBER` This pane runs a script which allows you to periodically save one of the checkpoint files that Piper generates during training and automatically convert it into a text-to-speech model.  This allows allows you to decide when your model is done training by listening to which checkpoint's version of the voice sounds the best.   Beware that leaving this tool unattended for a long time or saving checkpoint files frequently could quite easily fill your entire hard drive -- each checkpoint file is over 800MB.  You can set up an automatic shutdown if your available storage falls below a certain threshold by editing the global SETTINGS.txt file in `tts_dojo/DOJO_CONTENTS` before creating a new voice dojo.
4. `CONTROL CONSOLE` This pane displays information about the amount of storage your training session is using, and also provides several controls when it is selected. Select the CONTROL_CONSOLE pane by clicking it with a mouse or navigating to it with <CTRL>-B followed by arrow keys if you don't have a mouse, then:
    -  To shut down training: press `q`.
    -  To save the current tmux window layout: press `t`
    -  To restore a previous tmux window layout: press `r`
5. `VOICE TESTER` This pane allows you to hear what the voice associated with a saved checkpoint file sounds like.
   -  After at least one checkpoint has been saved and exported, a list of voice files will appear in this window.
   -  Select this window and use the arrow keys to highlight the version of the voice you want to hear, then press `s` to have it speak the text in the `"Text to say:"` field.
   -  Any voice that appears in the voice tester pane is ready to be used in your Piper projects.
   -  The finished voices are stored in  subfolders of `<VOICE_NAME_dojo>/tts_voices`
